#summary Getting Started Using Dimmunix for Java

= Quick Guide to Using Dimmunix for Java =

This guide helps you get Dimmunix and use it to immunize Java programs against deadlock bugs.

== Download and Install ==

Follow the instructions from [Installation]

== Use Dimmunix on a Test Program ==

The test program from DimmunixASM/src/Test.java deadlocks deterministically.
Go into DimmunixASM folder and run the deadlocking program by executing: 

*java -cp bin Test*

You notice that the test program deadlocks every time you run it.
You can terminate the program by typing *Ctrl-C*.

Now run the test program with Dimmunix by executing:

*java -cp bin:<path to asm-3.2>/lib/asm-3.2.jar -javaagent:<path to Dimmunix.jar> Test*

You notice that the program deadlocks in the first run.
Terminate the program with *Ctrl-C*.

Run the test program with Dimmunix again.
You notice that the program does not deadlock in the subsequent runs, if run with Dimmunix.

You can find the deadlock history in $HOME/Dimmunix/Dimmunix.hist
