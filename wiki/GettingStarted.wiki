We provide two distributions of Dimmunix: one for *Java* and one for *POSIX Threads*.
Java Dimmunix intercepts the synchronization operations using the [http://asm.ow2.org/ ASM instrumentation framework].
POSIX Threads Dimmunix works for *Linux* systems and intercepts synchronization operations using LD_PRELOAD.

Here is a [QuickGuideJava quick guide to using Java Dimmunix].

Here is a [QuickGuidePOSIXThreads quick guide to using POSIX Threads Dimmunix].

The early prototypes used for measurements reported in <a  
href=...>our paper</a> are available upon request. These older  
versions are harder to use, because they modify the NPTL library (for  
C/C++) and use AspectJ (for Java), respectively.
