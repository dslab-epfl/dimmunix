= Quick Guide to Using Dimmunix for POSIX Threads =

== Download and Install ==

Follow the instructions from [Installation].

== Use Dimmunix on Test C/C++ Programs ==

In dimmunix-pthreads-test/test.cc, dimmunix-pthreads-test/hawknl/src/deadlock3.c and dimmunix-pthreads-test/sqlite/deadlock_test/deadlock.c, you can find test programs that deadlock deterministically. 

To compile and run the tests, run
{{{
cd dimmunix-pthreads/test
sh ./run_tests
}}}

In the first run, each test deadlocks and Dimmunix saves the deadlock history in the folder containing the test. In future runs, the test never deadlocks again.

= Notes: =

 * We tested POSIX Threads Dimmunix on the following Linux distributions:
  * Ubuntu 9.10 32 bit
  * Ubuntu 9.04 32 bit
  * Ubuntu 8.10 32 bit
  * Ubuntu 9.10 64 bit
  * Fedora 11 32 bit
  * Fedora 9 32 bit
 * There are two deprecated versions of Dimmunix: one for Linux systems that is integrated in the NPTL library, and one for Java that is implemented using AspectJ. We can provide these distributions upon request.
