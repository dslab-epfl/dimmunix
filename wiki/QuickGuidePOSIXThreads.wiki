= Quick Guide to Using Dimmunix for POSIX Threads =

This guide helps you install POSIX Threads Dimmunix and use it to immunize C/C++ programs against deadlock bugs.

We tested POSIX Threads Dimmunix on the following Linux distributions:
  * Ubuntu 9.10 32 bit
  * Ubuntu 9.04 32 bit
  * Ubuntu 8.10 32 bit
  * Ubuntu 9.10 64 bit
  * Fedora 11 32 bit
  * Fedora 9 32 bit

== Install POSIX Threads Dimmunix ==

Create a folder where to download Dimmunix. 
{{{
mkdir $HOME/Dimmunix
cd $HOME/Dimmunix
}}}

=== Install Dimmunix From Source Code ===

1. Install scons, g++, gcc, make. To install these packages in Ubuntu, run:
{{{
sudo apt-get install make gcc g++ scons
}}} 
 The versions of these package on our Ubuntu 9.10 32 bit installation are: g++ 4.4.1, gcc 4.4.1, make 3.81, scons 1.2.0.
2. Check out POSIX Threads Dimmunix 
{{{
svn checkout http://dimmunix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pthreads dimmunix-pthreads
}}}
3. Compile POSIX Threads Dimmunix
{{{
cd dimmunix-pthreads/src
scons
cp libdimmunix.so $HOME/Dimmunix
}}}
 This will create libdimmunix.so shared library (in folder dimmunix-pthreads-src), that can be linked through LD_PRELOAD to any C/C++ program.

=== Install Dimmunix From Precompiled Binaries ===

Download Dimmunix library
{{{
cd $HOME/Dimmunix
wget http://dimmunix.googlecode.com/files/libdimmunix.so
}}}

== Use Dimmunix on Test C/C++ Programs ==

=== If you installed Dimmunix from source code ===

In dimmunix-pthreads/test/test.cc, dimmunix-pthreads/test/hawknl/src/deadlock3.c and dimmunix-pthreads/test/sqlite/deadlock_test/deadlock.c, you can find test programs that deadlock deterministically. 

To compile and run the tests, run
{{{
cd $HOME/Dimmunix/dimmunix-pthreads/test
sh ./run_tests
}}}

In the first run, each test deadlocks and Dimmunix saves the deadlock history in the folder containing the test. In future runs, the test never deadlocks again.

=== If you installed Dimmunix from precompiled binaries ===

 # Check out the test programs
{{{
cd $HOME/Dimmunix
svn checkout http://dimmunix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pthreads/test dimmunix-pthreads-test
}}}
 # To compile and run the tests, run
{{{
cd dimmunix-pthreads-test
sh ./run_tests
}}}
