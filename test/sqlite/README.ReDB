Do not run ./configure unless you read this

Runnig ./configure will overwrite the file libtool that will generate the build options so you should not do that 

In case you want to run configure, make a copy of the Makefile and libtool files first

edit the Makefile generated by configure to have TCC = klee-gcc ... etc
 
edit the Makefile to add a --tag CC when runnig libtool --mode=compile 

change TCC += -DTHREADSAFE=0 to TCC += -DTHREADSAFE=1 in the sqlite Makefile
 

llvm-ld, klee-gcc-lib (not klee-gcc), llvm-ar llvm-ranlib all need to be specified in libtool instead of their corespondents 

Type 
     make
     
     to make the sqlite library .... if you did not remove the -shared flags it will try to compile also the shared lib which will fail, need to work more on that 

     make -f nmakefile to make the deadlock test case

     to run with klee, type 

     make -f nmakefile run
